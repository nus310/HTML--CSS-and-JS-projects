        <p>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879.
            Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began 
            his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and
            Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he 
            entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as 
            a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his 
            diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find 
            a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the 
            Swiss Patent Office.In 1905 he obtained his doctor's degree.
            During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, 
            he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was 
            appointed Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he became Professor 
            Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics 
            at Prague, returning to Zurich in the following year to fill a 
            similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser 
            Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin.

        <p>Einstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics 
            and the determination to solve them. He had a strategy of his own and 
            was able to visualize the main stages on the way to his goal. He regarded 
            his major achievements as mere stepping-stones for the next advance.
            At the start of his scientific work, Einstein realized the inadequacies
            of Newtonian mechanics and his special theory of relativity stemmed from 
            an attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic 
            field. He dealt with classical problems of statistical mechanics and problems in 
            which they were merged with quantum theory: this led to an explanation of the 
            Brownian movement of molecules. He investigated the thermal properties of light 
            with a low radiation density and his observations laid the foundation of the photon 
            theory of light.In his early days in Berlin, Einstein postulated that the correct 
            interpretation of the special theory of relativity must also furnish 
            a theory of gravitation and in 1916 he published his paper on the general theory 
            of relativity. During this time he also contributed to the problems of the theory 
            of radiation and statistical mechanics.</p>
